# Welcome

Welcome to this tutorial for application development on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). We provide information and examples on how to develop and deploy an application based on [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap/) on SAP BTP using different tools and services step by step.

It's planned to provide multiple modules that are built upon each other. You can start the tutorial with the first module, or start in between, because the source code for every tutorial module is provided in this repository.

## Download and Installation

If you want to start from a specific tutorial module, get the name of its branch from the [tutorial](http://sap-samples.github.io/cloud-cap-risk-management), download this repository and switch to the desired branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-risk-management
cd cloud-cap-risk-management
git checkout create-cap-application
```
